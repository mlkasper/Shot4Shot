			<h2>Final Revision</h2>
			<h5>12/12/2018</h5>
			<p>Welcome to the end. We made it; the semester is over! Today we present the final &quot;polished&quot; version of the website.</p><br>
			<h3>Updates Include:</h3><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Directors Page with all directors of most viewed</li>
				<li>Locations page removed.</li>
				<li>Links fixed for pages that didn't redirect</li>
				<li>Favicon added for ALL pages this time... I promise..</li>
			</ul><br>
			<p>I had to change the scope again of the website. I realized that creating a location page with every single area that was being filmed, plus link to every movie would be impossible.
			This is due to time constraints, and just having not much time to do this with finals coming up and finishing. I really wanted to have a search where you could search your ZIP or location
			and have it show up. However, I had no way of allowing that on a github hosted website. I'm fairly certain that I couldn't run a PERL script on this, which would make it fairly impossible with 
			my knowledge of web programming.</p><br>
			<strong><p>Without further ado... I welcome you to Shot4Shot.</p></strong><br><br>

			<h2>Revision 3</h2>
			<h5>12/02/2018</h5>
			<p>Revision 3 is here, there are many new pages added, and some small tweaks.</p>
			<p>The movies that have been added from a movie location website &#40;Just the text&#41; so I was able to finish this website faster.</p>
			<p>Since this is an educational project there is no copywrite so I figured it would make the website more live-like.</p>
			<br><h3>Updates Include:</h3><br>
			<ul>
				<li>Removed &quot;Most Viewed&quot; section of the sidebar. This is due to some css issues and wanting the source HTML to be as sleek as possible.</li>
				<li>Added script to show when page was last updated.</li>
				<li>Favicon is added to all pages</li>
				<li>Finished Most Viewed Movies</li>
				<li>Footer links have been updated to include the about page, legal and privacy are filler since I don't have that information.</li>
				<li>Suggest a movie has a dummy page that includes information but does nothing.</li>
				<li>Links have been fixed and should all route the required pages.</li>
				
			</ul> <br>
			<h3>Coming Soon</h3> <br>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Add Directors, and Filming Locations</li>
				<li>Modify CSS and change the website up a bit.</li>
			</ul><br>
			<hr><br><br>
			<h2>Revision 2</h2>
			<h5>11/18/2018</h5>
			<p>Hello, revision two is here! </p> <br>
			<h3>Updates Include:</h3> <br>
			<ul>
				<li>Avengers: Infinity War - page added, only one so far.</li>
				<li>Updated page so background fits rest of page.</li>
				<li>Added background to main contents.</li>
				<li>Added links so the menu bar will redirect to it's corresponding pages.</li>
				<li>Main navagation bar at the top has been moved. Poor use of space is the main reason.</li>
				<li>Borders have been corrected to wrap around all contents in respective places.</li>
				
			</ul>
			<br>
			<h3>Coming Soon:</h3><br>
				<ul>
					<li>Direct Links to Pages</li>

				</ul>
